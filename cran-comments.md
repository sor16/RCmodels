## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.0
* macOS-latest (devel and release) on Github Actions
* windows-latest (release and R 3.6) on Github Actions
* ubuntu 18.04 (devel, release and and R 3.5) on Github Actions

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## CRAN Policy issues
* One helper function, save_report() writes a pdf file to the userâ€™s filesystem, but it requires permission from the user in an interactive R session
* The examples are slow, because in order to demonstrate the usage of most of the functions, a model has to be run. The model is fitted using an MCMC algorithm which can take up to a minute to run. I wrapped the examples in \donttest{}.
